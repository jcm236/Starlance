## Thrusters
- Thrusters now connect when directly adjacent, and can be controlled as one
- They can now set entities on fire, blocks on fire, push entities, evaporate water
- They can now consume fuel (can be set in config). Default is still no fuel for now

## New blocks 
- Added "Rocket Assembler", which provides a better way of assembling multiple block ships. Benefits include:
  - Can be used in space
  - Can assemble active create contraptions
  - Can be automated
- Added Gyro, which can rotate your ship when powered with redstone
- Added vent block, which simply prevents thrusters from setting fire past it

## Bug fixes:
- Fixed Cosmic Horizons crashing on rclick when a custom datapack is enabled
- Fixed thruster particles sometimes persisting after thruster destroyed (maybe)
- Fixed thruster force when at small scales
- Fixed log spam about "Found cosmos dimension, changing world height"

## Misc:
- Config option to disable chunk saving in space. Increases performance, but forces builds to be ships in space.
- Config option to place the "platform" in space from a nodule as a ship instead of blocks
- Probably some other stuff I don't remember
